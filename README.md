This repo powers my homelab/self hosted environment, unfortunately it's not feature complete at the moment.

This repo demonstrates skills with configuration management and infrast ructure provisioning including setting up a talos k8s cluster via a 'terraform apply'

My self hosted environment uses two docker hosts on proxmox. But that's absent from this repo. Eventually, time permitting I will achieve full IaC when I migrate my workloads to k8s.
